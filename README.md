# Online_Retailer_Customer_Segmentation

## Problem Statementüìù
This project aims to segment customers in an online retail dataset using RFM (Recency, Monetary, Frequency) analysis. 
The dataset covers transactional information from December 2010 to December 2011, providing valuable insights into customer behaviors. By applying clustering techniques, we can identify distinct customer segments based on their purchasing patterns.RFM analysis, encompassing recency, monetary value, and purchase frequency, allows us to differentiate customers and tailor marketing strategies accordingly. The analysis period captures a full year of customer behavior, including seasonal variations, trends, and changes in purchasing patterns

## Problem Approachüßë‚Äçüé§
- **Preprocess the dataset**: Clean the data, handle missing values, and transform variables as needed.
- **Calculate RFM values**: Calculate the recency, monetary, and frequency values for each customer based on their transaction history.
- **Normalize the RFM values**: Normalize the RFM values to bring them to a consistent scale for clustering.
- **Apply clustering algorithms**: Utilize clustering algorithms such as k-means or hierarchical clustering to group customers based on their RFM values.
- **Evaluate and interpret the clusters**: Analyze the resulting clusters, evaluate their characteristics, and interpret the customer segments based on their RFM values.
- **Develop targeted marketing strategies**: Based on the identified customer segments, tailor marketing strategies to address the specific needs and preferences of each segment.
